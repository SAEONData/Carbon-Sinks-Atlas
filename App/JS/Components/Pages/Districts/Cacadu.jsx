              <p>The models that estimate  the proposition of carbon as above ground woody carbon (AGW) are based on satellite imagery and do not differentiate between natural woody vegetation or planted trees. Below ground woody (BGW) carbon is based on AGW and varies across the country based on climate.</p>
              <p>Above ground herb (AGH) and below ground herb (BGH) is based on both natural vegetation and crop fields, on the proportional split per 1 km2 land unit. Litter is based on biome level estimates. </p>

            <p>Land cover is used to determine changes in carbon stocks, and land cover change is seen as one of the key drivers for change in terrestrial carbon. Data from three national land cover products, NLC 1990, NLC 2014 and NLC 2018 are compared against 17 (or 18) land cover classes.</p>
            <p>Only the 2018 land cover includes fallow land, which was mapped as natural land or agricultural land in earlier land cover products. The bare ground land cover classes was found to show large changes in extent between land cover products, possibly as a consequence of that years rainfall.</p>
            <p>Figure 2 gives a summary of land cover classes as mapped in the 2018 NLC.</p>

          <small>â€¢	Note, total change might reduce within a class over time because land in that class reverts to a different land use class. Change between 2014 and 2018 is due to the inclusion of fallow land losses in the 2018 data, and should not be interpreted as a change between those two years.  The 1990 to 2014 change data should be used to best understand long-term rates of loss, as the methodology for these two data sets was very similar. </small>
